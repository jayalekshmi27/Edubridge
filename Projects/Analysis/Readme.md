In this file Iam uploading different dashboard analysis,EDA,Machine Learning Algorithms that have done indiviually..
PROJECT1:
EXCEL DASHBOARDS-
Excel dashboards make it easy to perform quick overviews of data reports rather than going through large volumes of data. Overviews help in making quick and urgent decisions since one can skim through a lot of information at once and within a short time.


Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) is a method used to analyze and summarize datasets.Majority of the EDA techniques involve the use of graphs


PROJECT3:
TITANIC DATA ANALYSIS
It is one of the most popular datasets used for understanding machine learning basics.
It contains information of all the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, which unfortunately was shipwrecked.
This dataset can be used to predict whether a given passenger survived or not. 

The csv file can be downloaded from Kaggle.

Tool used :JUPYTER NOTEBOOK

The python libraries used:
1)Pandas

2)NumPy

3)Matplotlib

4)Seaborn

In this file Iam uploading different dashboard analysis,EDA,Machine Learning Algorithms that have done indiviually..

PROJECT1:

EXCEL DASHBOARDS-OLYMPIC MEDALS SUPERSTORE DATA

Excel dashboards make it easy to perform quick overviews of data reports rather than going through large volumes of data. 
Overviews help in making quick and urgent decisions since one can skim through a lot of information at once and within a short time.

It is Olympic season. Everyone I know is tracking the games and checking their countryâ€™s performance. One thing that we notice when looking at medal tally is,
A single Gold medal is worth more than any number of Silver medals. Like wise, a single Silver medal is worth more than any number of Bronze medals.
So, when you look at the ranking of countries, you see countries with single Gold medal higher up than countries with lots of Silver and Bronze medals (but no Gold).
This kind of informations can be easily extracted from  the dashboard created using Olympic medal Superstore Dataset

PROJECT2:

TABLEAU DASHBOARDS-UMEMPLOYEMENT SUPERSTORE DATA 

A dashboard is a collection of several views, letting you compare a variety of data simultaneously.
For example, if you have a set of views that you review every day, you can create a dashboard that displays all the views at once, rather than navigate to separate worksheets.
What makes a good dashboard is by avoid displaying the same information in different chart types to make them look cool.

Here Iam visualizing by comparing the unemployement rate a set of men and women participated in the study.
I can extract a lot of informations like reasons for massive unemployement,which region and time period have maximum unemployement rate etc


PROJECT3

TITANIC DATA ANALYSIS
Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) is a method used to analyze and summarize datasets.Majority of the EDA techniques involve the use of graphs

It is one of the most popular datasets used for understanding machine learning basics.
It contains information of all the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, which unfortunately was shipwrecked.
This dataset can be used to predict whether a given passenger survived or not. 

The csv file can be downloaded from Kaggle.

Tool used :JUPYTER NOTEBOOK

The python libraries used:
1)Pandas

2)NumPy

3)Matplotlib

4)Seaborn
